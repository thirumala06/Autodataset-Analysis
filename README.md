# Auto dataset-Fuel EfficiencyAnalysis
The Auto dataset was analyzed after removing missing values. The quantitative predictors include mpg, cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, and model year, while the qualitative predictors include origin and car name. The range, mean, and standard deviation of the quantitative variables showed that weight, displacement, and horsepower have large variability, whereas model year has lower variability. After removing the 10th to 85th observations, the statistical measures changed slightly, indicating the effect of extreme values on the dataset. Scatterplots revealed that mpg has a strong negative relationship with weight, displacement, and horsepower, and a positive relationship with model year. These plots suggest that variables such as weight, horsepower, displacement, and model year are useful predictors of fuel efficiency (mpg).
# Description
Analyzed the Auto dataset to study how vehicle characteristics affect fuel efficiency. Cleaned the data, classified predictors, computed descriptive statistics, and used scatterplots to explore relationships. Identified key factors influencing gas mileage (mpg).
