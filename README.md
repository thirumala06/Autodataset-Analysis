# Auto dataset-Fuel EfficiencyAnalysis
The Auto dataset was analyzed after removing missing values. Quantitative predictors include mpg, cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, and model year, while origin and car name are qualitative predictors. Weight, displacement, and horsepower showed high variability, whereas model year showed lower variability. After removing observations 10 to 85, the summary statistics changed slightly, showing the impact of extreme values. Scatterplots showed that mpg decreases with weight, displacement, and horsepower, and increases with model year, indicating these variables are useful for predicting fuel efficiency.
